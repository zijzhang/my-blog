The nature of cancer is abnormal proliferation of cells made of our organ, tissue and body.What drives physiology cells into crazy demons? Are genetic facrors or enviroment risks canse the transition of cells from health to disease? 

According to modern biological perspective, genome mutation results in the cell transformation.

# Cell changes and cancer

>All cancers begin in cells. Our bodies are made up of more than a hundred million million (100,000,000,000,000) cells. Cancer starts with changes in one cell or a small group of cells. 

>Usually, we have just the right number of each type of cell. This is because cells produce signals to control how much and how often the cells divide. If any of these signals are faulty or missing, cells may start to grow and multiply too much and form a lump called a tumour. A primary tumour is where the cancer starts. 

>Some types of cancer, called leukaemia, start from blood cells. They don't form solid tumours. Instead, the cancer cells build up in the blood and sometimes the bone marrow.

>For a cancer to start, certain changes take place within the genes of a cell or a group of cells.

# Gene changes within cells (mutations)

>Normally genes make sure that cells grow and reproduce in an orderly and controlled way. They make sure that all the cells produced are needed to keep the body healthy. 

>Sometimes a change happens in the genes when a cell divides. This is a mutation. It means that a gene has been damaged or lost or copied twice. Mutations can happen by chance when a cell is dividing. Some mutations mean that the cell no longer understands its instructions and starts to grow out of control. There have to be about half a dozen different mutations before a normal cell turns into a cancer cell.

>Mutations in particular genes may mean that a cell starts producing too many proteins that trigger a cell to divide. Or it stops producing proteins that normally tell a cell to stop dividing. Abnormal proteins may be produced that work differently to normal.

# Why does cancer sometimes come back?

>Cancer sometimes comes back after treatment. This is called a recurrence. Even if one cancer cell is left behind, it can grow and divide to become a new tumour. A new tumour can start to grow in the same area of the body where the cancer first started, or the cancer may have spread through the blood or lymphatic system to another part of the body, where it grows into a new tumour. This is why doctors sometimes use another treatment right after the first treatment, such as giving chemotherapy after surgery. This is called adjuvant therapy. The goal of adjuvant therapy is to help prevent the cancer from coming back in case some cancer cells are left behind in the body.

>In some cases, treatment may stop working (become resistant) so cancer cells are no longer being destroyed. So cancer that was shrinking or had disappeared may start to grow again and get bigger. This can happen when the genes inside cancer cells mutate. Some gene mutations make cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy and other drug treatments. If you become resistant to a treatment, your doctor may suggest that you try another one.

# Cure or remission

>Many cancers can be cured with treatment. But cancer that is thought to be cured can still come back even years later. This is why some doctors prefer to say that the cancer is in remission. Remission means there are fewer signs and symptoms of a disease (such as cancer) or that they have completely gone away.
