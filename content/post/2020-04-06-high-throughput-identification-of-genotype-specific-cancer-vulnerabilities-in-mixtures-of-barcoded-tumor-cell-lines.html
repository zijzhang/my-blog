<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of genetically characterized cell lines are available for the discovery of genotype-specific cancer &gt;vulnerabilities. However, screening large numbers of compounds against large numbers of cell lines is currently &gt;impractical, and such experiments are often difficult to control1-4. Here, we report a method called PRISM that allows &gt;pooled screening of mixtures of cancer cell lines by labeling each cell line with 24-nucleotide barcodes. PRISM &gt;displayed the expected patterns of cell killing seen in conventional (unpooled) assays. In a screen of 102 cell lines &gt;across 8,400 compounds, PRISM led to the identification of BRD-7880 as a potent and highly specific inhibitor of aurora &gt;kinases B and C. Cell line pools also efficiently formed tumors as xenografts, and PRISM recapitulated the expected &gt;pattern of erlotinib sensitivity in vivo</p>
