## My experience 

When doing the PhD thesis project, I want to detect the ROS-related genes expression by q-PCR. Nine sets of primers were used but only one of them had a positive result. The left eight genes were negtive in the cell line most colleagues used. It seemed impossible but it happened.

In the beginning, I suspected the primers were not right or in bad quality. Another eight new sets of primers were ordered but I still got negtive result. At that time I was very disappointed and trying to figure it out. I tried cDNA from another cell line. It is lucky to see that all the genes were expressed in this cell line.

Here, I begin to recognize that the cell line selection may influence your result.

## New discovery

The reseaons that your cell line can not produce the result as your expectation are the 

1,cell line contamination. The cell line you are cluturing may not be what it should be.

In the wikipedia [List of contaminated cell lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contaminated_cell_lines), you can find the useful information.

2, your cell line has changed. It is still the same line but it has new evolution.  
The cell lines are known to evolve in culture but the extent of genetic and transcriotional heterogeniciyt is hard to imagine.  The paper titled [Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell line drug response](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0409-3#article-info) reported that the caner cell line evoluation significantly influenced the drug response. Please refer the abstract below:

~Human cancer cell lines are the workhorse of cancer research. Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. **Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification**. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: **at least 75% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others**. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research~

## How to handle it if you have such an issue?

1 If you doubt your cell line, do a cell line authentication service.
2 In other perspective, when we are designing the experiment, the materials should be considered with cautious attitude.
