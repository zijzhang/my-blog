**This is review from nature reviews drug discovery,written by Asher Mullard.**

# Paul Workman, President of The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)
> This is the biggest problem that we face in cancer drug development,There are a whole slew of different mechanisms that contribute to resistance. We need to be creative and think about how to exploit this biology

# anti-evolution therapy

# Frederic de Sauvage, a molecular oncologist at Genentech
1. drugging drug-tolerant persister cells

2. 2010 Jeff settleman cell paper titled "A Chromatin-Mediated Reversible Drug-Tolerant State in Cancer Cell Subpopulations"

3. 2018 nature An in vivo model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) under treatment with the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor vismodegib. The morophlogy changes in the transition to persister cells

# possible plasticity preventers.
HDAC inhibitors, BET inhibitors and Wnt pathway blockers

# Innovative Medicines Initiative(IMI) EU
call for proposals to study the science of drug-tolerant persisters

# Tackling de novo mutations and stress-induced mutagenesis
Treatment drives mutagenesis. how cancers actually upregulate their mutation rates had previously remained elusive.
2019 Science Adaptive mutability of colorectal cancers in response to targeted therapies
1.  downregulate DNA-repair pathways on exposure to treatment
2. increased their use of error-prone DNA-replicating polymerases

# Jeff Engleman, Global Head of Oncology at Novartis

>1. Do other cancer–drug combinations similarly result in adaptive mutagenesis?  
>2. Does this process always involve downregulation of DNA-damage repair and upregulation of error-prone polymerases?  
>3. What upstream actors — and potential drug targets — detect the therapeutic stress and drive adaptive mutation?   
>4. And how do de novo mutations and pre-existing drug-resistant subclones act cooperatively to sidestep drugs

# APOBEC

APOBEC proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that can swap a cytosine base for a uracil.   
These proteins are part of the innate immune system, disrupting viral DNA to protect against infection, but they can also be hijacked by cancers to speed up mutation rates.  
APOBEC mutational signatures have been identified in at least 16 different cancers, and are associated with poor patient outcomes and treatment resistance.   
While the effects of these APOBEC-driven mutations are still a hot topic of research
