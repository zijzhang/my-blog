# Supercoil

+ Supercoiling allows for the compact packing of circular DNA

+ Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes usually have negative supercoiled DNA. 

+ Negative supercoiling is naturally prevalent because negative supercoiling prepares the molecule for processes that require separation of the DNA strands

+ RNA polymerase also influence DNA strand to have two different supercoiled directions. The region RNA polymerase has passed forms negative supercoil while the region RNA polymerase that have not passed forms positive supercoil. By these processes, supercoils are generated.

# Toposomerase 

+ responsible for the introduction and elimination of supercoils.

+ Type I stimulates the relaxation of supercoiled DNA and 

+ Type II uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to add negative supercoils to DNA


# Type I topoisomerases

+ Type IA topoisomerases enzyme is a 695-residue monomer and it relaxes negatively supercoiled DNA

+ Type IB mediates a controlled rotation mechanism to relax both negative and positive supercoils

# Type II topoisomerase

+ type IIA and type IIB topoisomerases, which share similar structure and mechanisms

+  through the coupling to ATP hydrolysis it can introduce negative supercoils


# Positive and Negative Supercoilings

1. Negative supercoiling is the **left-handed** coiling of DNA thus winding occurs in the **counterclockwise** direction. It is also known as the "**underwinding**" of DNA.

2. Positive supercoiling is the **right-handed**, coiling of DNA thus winding occurs in the **clockwise** direction. This process is also known as the "**overwinding**" of DNA.
