# Background

Why I started to read transplatation immnunology? 

I'm trying to kill glioblastoma with allogenic macropahges.

Here I recommended [immunopaedia](https://www.immunopaedia.org.za/immunology/advanced/1-transplantation/), which is supported by International Union of Immnunological Societies。

# Introduction

+ In a clinical setting, the term transplantation generally refers to the transfer or replacement of cells, tissues, or organs from one individual to another.

+ In the human, with the exception of transplantation of one’s own tissues, where the recognition of ‘‘self’’ components evokes no immune response, the transplantation of all other tissues, i.e., from another human or another species, triggers immune responses that are similar to those mounted against foreign substances and that can be complex and at times evoke severe complications.


+ Transplants are broadly classified as solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants


# Transplant Immunity

+ An auto-graft is a transplant of self-tissue or cells, e.g., skin or hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).  since they contain autoantigens or ‘‘self’’ antigens and under normal circumstances evoke no immune responses.

+ The term isograft is sometimes used when referring to a syngeneic transplant between two different genetically identical individuals.

    + In humans, only a transplant involving identical twins would be a true syngeneic isograft.

    + In an animal model, a syngeneic transplant would involve two animals derived from the same inbred strain.
    
+ The term allogeneic graft refers to a transplant that involves the transfer of an allograft containing alloantigens, which are genetically controlled characteristics that differentiate one member of a given species from another.

    + The vast majority of transplants carried out in humans are allogeneic.
    
    + However, due to the serious shortage of donor organs, researchers are actively investigating ways to successfully perform xenotranplantation, which involves the transfer of organs or tissues, i.e., a xenograft, containing xenoantigens between members of two different species.
    
+ The immune responses involved in transplantation are governed by the laws that are based on the genetics of the donor and recipient

+ The term ‘‘alloimmunity’’ is used to refer to the immune response stimulated by an alloantigen.

# The Immune Responses Involved in Transplantation

+ Alloreactivity: direct and indirect responses to alloan-tigen. 

    + Panel A: Direct alloresponses rely on the T cell receptor on recipient T cells recognizing the MHC of donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as foreign. This occurs without respect to the peptide in the cleft. Following migration of donor APCs to regional lymph-oid tissue of the recipient, the foreign MHC is recognized by the TCR of the recipient’s T cells with subsequent T cell activation and graft rejection. 
    
    + Panel B: In indirect alloresponses following trauma, foreign antigens are released from the graft and are processed by recipient APCs and the resultant peptides are presented to recipient T cells with subsequent T cell activation and graft rejection. In both cases, co-stimulation is required. [Reproduced with permission from Bellanti, JA (Ed). Immunology IV: Clinical Applications in Health and Disease.
