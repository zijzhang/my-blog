[Consequences of mitotic slippage for antimicrotubule drug therapy](https://erc.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/erc/24/9/T97.xml)

# Antimitotic agents

Microtubule poisons are divided into taxanes and vinca alkaloids depending on how they affect microtubule dynamics. Taxanes are microtubule-stabilising drugs that inhibit the dynamic instability of spindles; examples include commonly-used drugs such as paclitaxel and docetaxel. Vinca alkaloids depolymerise microtubules thereby preventing their attachment to kinetochores; drugs such as vinblastine, vincristine and vinolrelbine fall into this categor

# SAC  spindle assembly checkpoint

The SAC prevents improper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit via inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC)   
he APC has been shown to be responsible for controlling cyclin B1 levels during mitosis since APC-induced degradation of cyclin B1 engenders cells to exit mitosis

# Inhibiting the APC leads to cells arresting in mitosis

Depending on the biological context and cell type, cells blocked in mitosis can eventually undergo mitotic cell death, thereby fulfilling the anti-proliferative function of antimicrotubule drugs

# Mitotic slippage

Besides mitotic cell death, an alternative route that cells can also take following a SAC-enforced mitotic arrest is mitotic slippage. Attenuation of the SAC resulting in slow degradation of cyclin B1during a protracted mitotic arrest can cause cells to prematurely exit mitosis
