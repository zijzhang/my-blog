# Concept

The measured rate of mutation reflects a balance between the
number of damaging events occurring in DNA and the number that
have been corrected.

The response to damage includes activation and
recruitment of repair enzymes; modification of chromatin structure;
activation of cell cycle checkpoints; and, in the event of insufficient
repair in multicellular organisms, apoptosis

# Three type damage

1. single-base changes : deamination of cytosine to uracil
2. structural distortions/bulky lesions,
3. strand breaks

# Direct repair

One good example is photoreactivation of pyrimidine dimers  
Photoreactivation is a nonmutagenic repair system

# Excision repair 
directly replaces damaged DNA and then resynthesizes a replacement stretch for the damaged strand

# Mismatch repair (MMR)
This system also recognizes insertion/deletion loops 
in which sequences present in one strand that are absent in the
complementary strand are looped out.  
Mismatches and
insertion/deletion loops that arise during replication are corrected
by distinguishing between the “new” and “old” strands and
preferentially correcting the sequence of the newly synthesized strand

# recombination-repair
use homologous recombination to replace the double-stranded region that has been damaged.
# uvr excision repair system in E coli

1. uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC encode the components of a repair
endonuclease
2. a UvrAB dimer recognizes pyrimidine dimers and other bulky lesions.
3. UvrA dissociates (this requires
adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), and UvrC joins UvrB. The UvrBC
complex makes an incision on each side
4. UvrD is a helicase that helps to unwind the DNA to allow
release of the single strand between the two cuts
5. The enzyme that
excises the damaged strand is DNA polymerase I. The enzyme
involved in the repair synthesis also is likely to be DNA polymerase
I
6. short-patch repair 12bp  99%
7. long-patch repair 1500bp 1%
8. The Uvr complex can also be directed to sites of damage by other
proteins. For exampe Mfd

# Eukaryotic Nucleotide Excision Repair Pathways

1. Bulky lesions, such as those created by UV
damage, crosslinking agents, and numerous chemical carcinogens,
are also recognized and repaired by a nucleotide excision repair
system

2. xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a recessive disease
resulting in hypersensitivity to sunlight, and UV light in particular.
The deficiency results in skin disorders and cancer predisposition.

3. Global renome repair and transcription coupled repair
4. In global genome repair (GG-NER),
the XPC protein detects the damage and initiates the repair
pathway.

5. XPC also detects distortions that are not repaired by GG-NER (such as small
unwound regions of DNA)
6. some types of damage, such as UV-induced
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), are not well recognized by
XPC. In this case, the DNA damage-binding (DDB) complex assists
in recruiting XPC to this type of damage.

7.In contrast, transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), the damage is
recognized by RNA polymerase II itself, which stalls when it
encounters a bulky lesion

8. The strands of DNA are unwound
for about 20 bp around the damaged site. This action is performed
by the helicase activity of the transcription factor TFIIH,

9. the transcription factor TFIIH, itself a
large complex, which includes the products of two XP genes, XPB
and XPD. XPB and XPD are both helicases; the XPB helicase is
required for promoter melting during transcription, whereas the
XPD helicase performs the unwinding function in NER

10. In the next step, cleavages are made on either side of the lesion by
endonucleases encoded by the XPG and XPF genes.

11. XPG is
related to the endonuclease flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), which
cleaves DNA during the base excision repair pathway


12. Finally, the single-stranded stretch including the damaged bases
can then be replaced by new synthesis, and the final remaining nick
is ligated by a complex of ligase 3 and XRCC1
