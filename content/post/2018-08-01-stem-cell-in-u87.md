 Are there stem cells in the cell line cultures? Yes, some cell lines have.
 
 U87 is one gliblastoma cell line containing stem cell. You can isolate them following the protocol below.

> All the monolayer growing cell lines, U373 (22–25th passage), U87-MG (52–55th passage) and LI (93–95th passage) were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/ml, in a defined serum-free medium, DMEM/F12, supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin 100 IU/ml, streptomycin 100 µm/ml), HEPES (10 mM), glutamine (2 mM), glucose (0.3% w/v), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) (20 ng/ml, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/ml, R & D Systems) and N-2 Plus Media Supplement (R & D Systems) (Neural Stem Cell Medium, hereafter named: NSCM). The medium was changed every 2 days. Spheres were split by mechanical dissociation when they reached a size of 100–200 cells.

> U87 glioblastoma cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2  104 cells/well (Sunnub Bio-tech, Shanghai, China) containing 500 ll DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, USA) for 12–18 h. Thereafter,250 ll culture medium was replaced with an equal  of serum-free neural stem cell medium containing DMEM/F12 (Gibco), B27 (1, Gibco), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF, 20 ng/ml;Sigma, USA),basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF,20 ng/ml; Upstate, USA), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, 10 ng/ml; Chemicon, USA), insulin (4 U/l; Sigma),with or without vincristine (5 ng/ml; Hualian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). This procedure was repeated every 24 h until several primary tumor spheres were visible under microscopy. At this point, all culture medium was discarded and the wells were filled with 1 ml fresh serum-free neural stem cell medium.
