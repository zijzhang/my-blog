**One major reason for failure of HBV treatment is the inability to eradicate or
inactivate the viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is a stable episomal form of the viral genome deco-
rated with host histones and nonhistone proteins**

**HBV cccDNA exists in the nucleus as
multiple copies of nucleosome-decorated minichromo-
somes**

**five nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs), including lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir, that inhibit HBV reverse transcription**

**Epigenetic therapy, a novel strategy targeting
epigenetic modifications, was first applied successfully
to leukemia treatment.**

# HBV Life Cycle and cccDNA Biology

1. The mechanism by which the virus is endocytosed into the cytoplasm has not been completely demonstrated
2. The detailed molecular mechanisms of nucleocapsid disassembly and cccDNA biosynthesis remain elusive
3.  Nucleosomes are nonrandomly positioned
on the cccDNA of duck HBV (DHBV)
4. The cccDNA minichromosome is stably maintained in quiescent hepatocytes with a long half-life and is responsible for the persistence of infection during the natural course of chronic infection and prolonged antiviral treatment.
5. cccDNA is inherently stable.

# Epigenetic Control of HBV Infection - DNA modificaiton

>  DNA methylation only occurs on the nuclear HBV-DNA forms, but not the histone-free cytoplasmic core DNA or virion DNA.

> the integration of HBV DNA into the human chromosome was frequently detected in HCCsfrom CHB patients. Integrated HBV
DNA are methylated and silenced in the SNU398 HCC cell line


# HISTONE MODIFICATIONS OF THE CCCDNA MINICHROMOSOME

**PTMs of histones and nonhistone proteins that either directly bind to cccDNA sequence or bind to cccDNA minichromosome through protein-protein interactions have become an active area of research**
