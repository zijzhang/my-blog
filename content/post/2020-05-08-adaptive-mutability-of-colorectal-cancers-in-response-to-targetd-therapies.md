# Abstract

The emergence of drug resistance limits the efficacy of targeted therapies in human tumors. The prevalent view is that resistance is a fait accompli: when treatment is initiated, cancers already contain
drug-resistant mutant cells. Bacteria exposed to antibiotics transiently increase their mutation rates (adaptive mutability), thus improving the likelihood of survival. We investigated whether human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells likewise exploit adaptive mutability to evade therapeutic pressure. We found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/BRAF inhibition down-regulates mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination DNA-repair genes and concomitantly up-regulates error-prone polymerases in drug-tolerant (persister) cells. MMR proteins were also down-regulated in patient-derived xenografts and tumor specimens during therapy. EGFR/BRAF inhibition induced DNA damage, increased mutability, and triggered microsatellite instability. Thus, like unicellular organisms, tumor cells evade therapeutic pressures by enhancing mutability

# introduction

1.  Old view: baterial resistance to phage was due to random mutations
that spontanesously occurred in the absense of selction. So is the tumor.
2. Resistance to target therapy can by fostered by a transient increase in genome instability during treatment, leading to de novo mutagenesis.
The microbial strain resistant to antibiotics is similar. stress induced mutagenesis have been described in bacteria and yeast
3. 



# In 2010 Jeff Settleman cell paper, what did they say?
1. NSCLC PC9 EGFR mutant treat with EGFR TKI (2 uM Gefitinib and erlotibin) 100 fold greater than IC50
2. viable quescent cells can be detected 9 days later
3. 0.3% of the the starting PC9 population

# microsatellite-stable (MSS) human colorectal cancer

MSI:microsatellite Instable
MSI-H: Mismatch Repair Genes  don't work correctly.
MSS:Microsatellite Stable
MSS:The opposite of MSI-high
