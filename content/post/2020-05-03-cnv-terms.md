# Allele

An allele is one of a series of alternative forms (genotypes) at locus, or a specific region of a chromosome. At the DNA level, different alleles have different base sequences.

# Allelic fraction

The allelic fraction can be defined as the number of times a mutated base is observed, divided by the total number of times any base is observed at the locus.  
Allelic fraction is generally applied to a single mutation in a tumor, and thus is distinct from allelic frequency, which examines the frequency of an allele in a population  
Mutation fraction can be defined as the ratio between mutant and wild-type alleles in a tumor sample

# Allele frequency
Allele frequency, or gene frequency, is the relative frequency of an allele (variant of a gene) at a particular locus in a **population**, expressed as a fraction or percentage

# CNV
Refers to the genetic trait involving the number of copies of a particular gene present in the genome of an individual. Genetic variants, including insertions, deletions, and duplications of segments of DNA, are also collectively referred to as CNVs. CNVs account for a significant proportion of the genetic variation between individuals. Also called copy number variant.
