It is from one review from 

> Herbert A. Z-DNA and Z-RNA in human disease. Commun Biol. 2019;2:7. Published 2019 Jan 7. doi:10.1038/s42003-018-0237-x


#  Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome
>Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) is an inherited encephalopathy that affects newborn infants and usually results in severe mental and physical handicap
>Loss-of-function mutations in ADAR p150 allow persistent activation of the interferon system by Alu dsRNAs and are causal for Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome

# ADAR

1. An important inflection point has been the identification of the Z-DNA binding domain named Zα from the dsRNA editing protein ADAR 

2. This domain’s specificity for the left-handed conformation of Z-DNA was shown in a series of high-resolution NMR and X-ray studies.The interactions between Zα and Z-DNA are conformation-specific, with no base-specific contacts

3. The interactions between Zα and Z-DNA are conformation-specific, with no base-specific contacts

4. Heterodimers of ADAR and DICER1 regulate the switch from RNA- to protein-centric immunity
