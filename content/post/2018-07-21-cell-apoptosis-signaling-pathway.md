## Background

I reviewed several manuscripts titled liket "XX promotes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis in YY cells".

Here, "XX" can be any chemical from nature product or synthezed in the lab. 
"YY" can be caner cells, nenron cells and various cells. They may be cell lines or primary cells.
By combination, hundreds of paper can be produced. How do you evaluate them in the perspective of basic reserch or drug development? 

Next I will discuss some of my conerns about it


## 1, The difference of viability and proliferation

Usually, viability is to descibe the status of a cell or a popuslaton of cells. 

## 2, The knowledage of apoptosis


Two classical signaling pathway

Intrinsic 

Extrinsic

## 3, Is such research helpful to drug discovery?
