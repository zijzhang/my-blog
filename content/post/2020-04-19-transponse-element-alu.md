[Functions and Utility of Alu Jumping Genes](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/functions-and-utility-of-alu-jumping-genes-561/)

# Alu

they are the most abundant type of human TE, making up an amazing 10% of the (diploid) human genome. Thus, in a mere 65 million years, these transposons have gone from zero to about 1 million copies per cell! Indeed, part of what makes Alu elements so important is that they are found in nearly every human (and other primate) gene. These elements are spread throughout the genome and occur at varying densities in different loci.

# Transposable Elements Are More Than Just “Jumping Genes”

1. many Alu RNAs are expressed during times of stress

2. Alu elements may have served an important evolutionary role 
    + by contributing to the formation of new genes or gene combination
    + by adding new functionality to already-existing genes through a process known as exonization
    + Alu TEs are responsible for an estimated 62% of all new exons 
    + Alu elements have played a key role in the evolution of the primate brain, and that all of the protein possibilities afforded by Alu movement and exonization have contributed to the complexity of human neuronal circuitry and "higher-order" cognition (e.g., rational thought) (Mattick & Mehler, 2008).

3. scientists have associated some individual Alu insertions with human disease
    + in 1991, researchers discovered a case of neurofibromatosis caused by an Alu sequence inserted in an intron of the NF1 gene (Wallace et al., 1991)
    + Alu-disease associations in disorders ranging from hemophilia to breast cancer
    
    
# Use of Alu Elements in Molecular Biology as Important Genetic Markers
1. Alu elements are widely dispersed throughout the primate genome but absent in other animals makes these elements a useful tool for identifying human DNA sequences that have been inserted into cells of other animals in what are known as marker-rescue experiments.

2. A classic Alu marker-rescue experiment was the 1982 discovery of the first human oncogene by Robert Weinberg and his trainee Chiaho Shih (Shih & Weinberg, 1982).

# Use of Alu Elements in Evolutionary Biology

1. genetic polymorphic loci (i.e., DNA sequences that vary within the population) and make them ideal for answering certain types of questions about genetic ancestry and relatedness
2. humans are more closely related to chimpanzees than to gorillas.

# Uses of Alu Elements in Forensic Science

1. The inference of an individual's geographic ancestry or origin can be critical in narrowing the field of potential suspects in a criminal investigation
