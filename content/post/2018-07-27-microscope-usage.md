## background

Lots of slides were stained by immunohistochemisty, but i can not get good pictures. Today I recognized my misusage of microscope with my supervisor's help. 

## How should I take picutres withe microscope to get clear result?

For the immunohistochemisty staining with DAB and couterstaining with hematoxilin.

At the beginning, I tried the bright field with Ph1 and it was wrong. The picutures were very urgly and seemed not like the real condition.

with the DIC mode with DIC component, It is very clear. Blue and brown colors are distinct and looks like very beautiful. 

Withe bright field with Ph2, DIC, Ph3 and A, they all look different with the beginning.

The tip is that when you take picutures with bright field, the ph1, ph2, ph3, DIC and A need more attentions.

The microscope is Nikon Eclipse Ti-E



## Knowledge of microscope in the bright field mode

The objective is key to acquire images wihe best quality in the microscope system. Some numbers and letters are labeled on the surface of each objective. if you unstand what they mean, more information about how to use the objective will help you with artist images. Here I listed is an example objective.

WD: working distance

Plan : Flat-field correction; Apo: Aberration correction

60X 0.95: lateral magenification/numerical aperture

DIC M :specialized optical proerties

Tube length/cover glass thickness range

cover glass adjustment guage

correction colar

magnification color code

Nosepiece mounting thread

Phase contact
