# Mutator

A mutation or a mutated gene that increases the basal level of
mutation. Such genes often code for proteins that are involved
in repairing damaged DNA.A mutator mutant has an
increased frequency of spontaneous mutation.

# Mut genes

Functions in this group
include the Dam methylase that identifies the target for repair and
enzymes that participate directly or indirectly in the removal of
particular types of damage (MutH, -S, -L, and -Y).

This deamination event generates a G-T pair, and the
system that acts on such pairs has a bias to correct them to G-C
pairs (rather than to A-T pairs). The system that undertakes this
reaction includes the MutL and MutS products that remove thymine
from both G-T and C-T mismatches.

# The MutT, -M, -Y system handles the consequences of oxidative damage

MutT hydrolyzes the damaged precursor
8-oxo-dGTP, which prevents it from being incorporated into DNA  

When guanine is oxidized in DNA its partner is cytosine, and MutM
preferentially removes the 8-oxo-G from 8-oxo-G-C pairs.  

However, oxidized guanine mispairs with adenine, and so if 8-oxo-G
persists in DNA and is replicated, it generates an 8-oxo-G-A pair.
MutY removes adenine from these pairs  

MutM and MutY are
glycosylases that directly remove a base from DNA. This creates
an apurinic site that is recognized by an endonuclease whose
action triggers the involvement of the excision repair system

# Dam

E. coli dam mutants show an increased rate of spontaneous
mutation.

eukaryotic mismatch repair systems do not use DNA
methylation to select the daughter strand for repair
