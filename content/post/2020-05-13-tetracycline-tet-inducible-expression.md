#  Tet Response Element (TRE)

A TRE is 7 repeats of a 19 nucleotide tetracycline operator (tetO) sequence, and is recognized by the tetracycline repressor (tetR). In the endogenous bacterial system, if tetracycline, or one of its analogs like doxycycline, are present, tetR will bind to tetracycline and not to the TRE, permitting transcription.  
Tetracycline-dependent promoters are developed by placing a TRE upstream of a minimal promoter.

# Tetracycline Off System ( tTA-dependent system)

tTA (tetracycline-controlled transactivator) = tetR+VP16

In the absence of tetracycline, the tetR portion of tTA will bind these tetO sequences and the activation domain promotes expression

In the presence of tetracycline, tetracycline binds to tetR. This precludes tTA binding to the tetO sequences and subsequent increase in expression by the activation domain, resulting in reduced gene expression

# Tetracycline On System ( rtTA-dependent system.)

rtTA ( reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator) = mut-tetR + VP16

In the presense of tetracycline, tetracycline binds to mut-tetR and the activation domain promotes expression and versus.
