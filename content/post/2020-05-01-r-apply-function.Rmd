apply() takes Data frame or matrix as an input and gives output in vector, list or array. apply() Function is primarily used to avoid explicit uses of loop constructs. It is the most basic of all collections can be used over a matrice.

This function takes 3 arguments:

> apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)  
Here:  
-x: an array or matrix  
-MARGIN:  take a value or range between 1 and 2 to define where to apply the function:  
-MARGIN=1`: the manipulation is performed on rows  
-MARGIN=2`: the manipulation is performed on columns  
-MARGIN=c(1,2)` the manipulation is performed on rows and columns
-FUN: tells which function to apply. Built functions like mean, median, sum, min, max and even user-defined functions can be applied>

```{r}
m1 <- matrix(C<-(1:10), nrow=5, ncol=6)
m1
a_m1 <- apply(m1, 2, sum)
a_m1
```
