+ Damaged DNA that has not been repaired causes
prokaryotic DNA polymerase III to stall during replication

+ DNA polymerase V (encoded by umuCD) or DNA
polymerase IV (encoded by dinB) can synthesize a
complement to the damaged strand.

+ The DNA synthesized by repair DNA polymerases often
has errors in its sequence

+ most systems,
including uvr-controlled excision repair, do not differ significantly
from DNA replication in the frequency of mistakes

+ The error-prone pathway, also known as translesion synthesis,
was first observed when it was found that the repair of damaged λ
phage DNA is accompanied by the induction of mutations if the
phage is introduced into cells that had previously been irradiated
with UV light.

+ What is the actual error-prone activity? It is a specialized DNA
polymerase that inserts random (and thus usually incorrect) bases
when it passes any site at which it cannot insert complementary
base pairs in the daughter strand.

+ The UmuD′ C complex has DNA polymerase activity. It is called
DNA polymerase V and is responsible for synthesizing new DNA to
replace sequences that have been damaged by UV irradiation

+ When the replicase (DNA polymerase III) encounters a block, such
as a thymidine dimer, it stalls. It is then displaced from the
replication fork and replaced by DNA polymerase V. In fact, DNA
polymerase V uses some of the same ancillary proteins as DNA
polymerase III.

+ The same situation is true for DNA polymerase IV,
the product of dinB, which is another enzyme that acts on
damaged DNA.

+ DNA polymerases IV and V are part of a larger family of
translesion polymerases, which includes eukaryotic DNA
polymerases and whose members are specialized for repairing
damaged DNA.

+ this family also includes
the RAD30 gene coding for DNA polymerase η of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and the XPV gene described previously that encodes
the human homolog
