# Glycosylases and lyases.

  Enzymes that remove bases from DNA
  
# Long-patch pathway

  Glycosylase action is followed by the endonuclease APE1, which
cleaves the polynucleotide chain on the 5′ side. This, in turn,
attracts a replication complex that includes DNA polymerase δ/ε
and ancillary components. The replication complex performs a
short synthesis reaction extending for 2 to 10 nucleotides. The
displaced material is removed by the flap endonuclease (FEN1).
The enzyme ligase 1 seals the chain. This is called the long-patch
pathway

# Short-patch pathway

When the initial removal involves lyase action, the endonuclease
APE1 instead recruits DNA polymerase β to replace a single
nucleotide. The nick is then sealed by the ligase XRCC1/ligase 3.
This is called the short-patch pathway

# Base flipping

1. A human enzyme, alkyladenine DNA glycosylase
(AAG), recognizes and removes a variety of alkylated substrates,
including 3-methyladenine(3mA), 7-methylguanine(7mG), and hypoxanthine

2. 1-methyl-adenine is corrected by
an enzyme that uses an oxygenating mechanism. The methyl group is
oxidized to a CH OH group, and then the release of the HCHO
moiety (formaldehyde) restores the structure of adenine

3. One of the most common reactions in which a base is directly
removed from DNA is catalyzed by uracil-DNA glycosylase. Uracil
typically only occurs in DNA because of spontaneous deamination
of cytosine

4. Another enzyme that uses base flipping is the photolyase that
reverses the bonds between pyrimidine dimers

# An exception

Rad4 flips out the two adenine bases that are complementary to the linked thymines in a pyrimidine dimer, rather than flipping out the damaged pyrimidine
dimer itself. the protein uses flipping as an indirect mechanism to detect
the loss of a normal base-paired DNA double helix.
