      <description>One major reason for failure of HBV treatment is the inability to eradicate or inactivate the viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is a stable episomal form of the viral genome deco- rated with host histones and nonhistone proteins
HBV cccDNA exists in the nucleus as multiple copies of nucleosome-decorated minichromo- somes
five nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs), including lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir, that inhibit HBV reverse transcription
Epigenetic therapy, a novel strategy targeting epigenetic modifications, was first applied successfully to leukemia treatment.</description>
