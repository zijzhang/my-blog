<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I reviewed several manuscripts titled liket &ldquo;XX promotes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis in YY cells&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here, &ldquo;XX&rdquo; can be any chemical from nature product or synthezed in the lab. 
&ldquo;YY&rdquo; can be caner cells, nenron cells and various cells. They may be cell lines or primary cells.
By combination, hundreds of paper can be produced. How do you evaluate them in the perspective of basic reserch or drug development?</p>
<p>Next I will discuss some of my conerns about it</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-of-viability-and-proliferation">The difference of viability and proliferation</h2>
<p>Usually, viability is to descibe the status of a cell or a popuslaton of cells.</p>
<h2 id="the-knowledage-of-apoptosis">The knowledage of apoptosis</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, or “cellular suicide.” It is different from necrosis, in which cells die due to injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apoptosis is an orderly process in which the cell’s contents are packaged into small packets of membrane for “garbage collection” by immune cells.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apoptosis removes cells during development, eliminates potentially cancerous and virus-infected cells, and maintains balance</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="two-classical-signaling-pathwayintrinstic-and-extrinsic">Two classical signaling pathway(Intrinstic and extrinsic)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Intrinsic</p>
<ol>
<li>The mitochondria are essential to multicellular life. Without them, a cell ceases to respire aerobically and quickly dies. This fact forms the basis for some apoptotic pathways. Apoptotic proteins that target mitochondria affect them in different ways. They may cause mitochondrial swelling through the formation of membrane pores, or they may increase the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and cause apoptotic effectors to leak out. They are very closely related to intrinsic pathway, and tumors arise more frequently through intrinsic pathway than the extrinsic pathway because of sensitivity.There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that nitric oxide is able to induce apoptosis by helping to dissipate the membrane potential of mitochondria and therefore make it more permeable. Nitric oxide has been implicated in initiating and inhibiting apoptosis through its possible action as a signal molecule of subsequent pathways that activate apoptosis.</li>
<li>During apoptosis, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria through the actions of the proteins Bax and Bak. The mechanism of this release is enigmatic, but appears to stem from a multitude of Bax/Bak homo- and hetero-dimers of Bax/Bak inserted into the outer membrane. Once cytochrome c is released it binds with Apoptotic protease activating factor – 1 (Apaf-1) and ATP, which then bind to pro-caspase-9 to create a protein complex known as an apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves the pro-caspase to its active form of caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates pro-caspase into the effector caspase-3.</li>
<li>Mitochondria also release proteins known as SMACs (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) into the cell&rsquo;s cytosol following the increase in permeability of the mitochondria membranes. SMAC binds to proteins that inhibit apoptosis (IAPs) thereby deactivating them, and preventing the IAPs from arresting the process and therefore allowing apoptosis to proceed. IAP also normally suppresses the activity of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases, which carry out the degradation of the cell. Therefore, the actual degradation enzymes can be seen to be indirectly regulated by mitochondrial permeability.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Extrinsic</p>
<ul>
<li>Two theories of the direct initiation of apoptotic mechanisms in mammals have been suggested: the TNF-induced (tumor necrosis factor) model and the Fas-Fas ligand-mediated model, both involving receptors of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family[35] coupled to extrinsic signals</li>
</ul>

<p>No.</p>
