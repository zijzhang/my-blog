<h1>Why we need tSNE?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have worked with a dataset before with a lot of features, you can fathom how difficult it is to understand or explore the relationships between the features. Not only it makes the EDA process difficult but also affects the machine learning model’s performance since the chances are that you might overfit your model or violate some of the assumptions of the algorithm, like the independence of features in linear regression. This is where dimensionality reduction comes in</p>

<div id="what-is-tsne" class="section level1">
<h1>What is tSNE?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a (prize-winning) technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In machine learning, dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. By reducing the dimension of your feature space, you have fewer relationships between features to consider which can be explored and visualized easily and also you are less likely to overfit your model.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a linear feature extraction technique. It performs a linear mapping of the data to a lower-dimensional space in such a way that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. It is extensively applied in image processing, NLP, genomic data and speech processing</p>

<h1>How to do tSNE</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>For the standard t-SNE method, implementations in Matlab, C++, CUDA, Python, Torch, R, Julia, and JavaScript are available.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is highly recommended to use another dimensionality reduction method (e.g., PCA for dense data or TruncatedSVD for sparse data) to reduce the number of dimensions to a reasonable amount (e.g., 50) if the number of features is very high. This will suppress some noise and speed up the computation of pairwise distances between samples.</em></p>
