<blockquote>
<p>The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) has historically been categorized into monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages on the basis of functional and phenotypical characteristics. However, considering that these characteristics are often overlapping, the distinction between and classification of these cell types has been challenging.In this Opinion article, we propose a unified nomenclature for the MPS. We suggest that these cells can be classified primarily by their ontogeny and secondarily by their location, function and phenotype. We believe that this system permits a more robust classification during both steady-state and inflammatory conditions, with the benefit of spanning different tissues and across species.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="a-historical-perspective">A historical perspective</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the original description of the MPS, the advent of polychromatic flow cytometry has enabled the assessment of different surface markers and allowed an unparalleled exploration of cellular phenotype and heterogeneity. This has facilitated the characterization of multiple distinct DC, monocyte and macrophage subsets in mice</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="a-new-nomenclature-for-the-mps">A new nomenclature for the MPS</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>mononuclear phagocytes should first be defined on the basis of their ontogeny (level one) and that these cells can subsequently be classified on the basis of their function, location and/or phenotype (level two)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="classifying-mouse-dendritic-cells">Classifying mouse dendritic cells</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>DCs should be classified as a separate lineage of mononuclear phagocytes on the basis of the fact that they arise from adult haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-derived precursors that are distinct from the precursors of monocytes and macrophages<br>
subdivide DCs into only three main subtypes — two main lineages of cDCs (which we propose should be called ‘classical type 1 DCs (cDC1s)’ for CD8α+ and CD103+ DCs, and ‘cDC2s’ for CD11b+ and CD172a+ DCs, on the basis of their distinct developmental pathways) and pDCs, which retain their original name.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="mouse-macrophages">Mouse macrophages</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>microglia, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages and splenic red pulp macrophages should be defined as part of the macrophage family but we propose to keep their historical name</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="mouse-monocyte-derived-cells">Mouse monocyte-derived cells</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Mouse monocytes consist of two subtypes — namely, LY6Chi classical monocytes and LY6Clow non-classical monocytes80. LY6Chi classical monocytes derive from the recently identified cMoP31. Undifferentiated LY6Chi classical monocytes are not only found in the blood but also in several steady-state tissues, including the spleen, lymph nodes, skin and lungs32,33,81. LY6Clow non-classical monocytes remain mostly within the blood vessels where they patrol the vascular wall82. Whether all LY6Clow blood monocytes differentiate from LY6Chi monocytes83,84,25 is still a matter of debate. Until this is firmly established, we retain the term LY6Clow non-classical monocytes. By contrast, LY6Chi classical monocytes are the definitive precursors of many mononuclear phagocytes and in certain adult tissues — including the gut, heart and dermis — these cells rely on continuous monocytic input for their maintenance in the steady state</p>
