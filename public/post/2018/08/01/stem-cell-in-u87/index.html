<p>Are there stem cells in the cell line cultures? Yes, some cell lines have.</p>
<p>U87 is one gliblastoma cell line containing stem cell. You can isolate them following the protocol below.</p>
<p>Lacopino F, Angelucci C, Piacentini R, Biamonte F, Mangiola A, et al. (2014) Isolation of Cancer Stem Cells from Three Human Glioblastoma Cell Lines: Characterization of Two Selected Clones. PLOS ONE 9(8): e105166. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105166">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105166</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the monolayer growing cell lines, U373 (22–25th passage), U87-MG (52–55th passage) and LI (93–95th passage) were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/ml, in a defined serum-free medium, DMEM/F12, supplemented with antibiotics (penicillin 100 IU/ml, streptomycin 100 µm/ml), HEPES (10 mM), glutamine (2 mM), glucose (0.3% w/v), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) (20 ng/ml, R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/ml, R &amp; D Systems) and N-2 Plus Media Supplement (R &amp; D Systems) (Neural Stem Cell Medium, hereafter named: NSCM). The medium was changed every 2 days. Spheres were split by mechanical dissociation when they reached a size of 100–200 cells.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U87 glioblastoma cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2  104 cells/well (Sunnub Bio-tech, Shanghai, China) containing 500 ll DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, USA) for 12–18 h. Thereafter,250 ll culture medium was replaced with an equal  of serum-free neural stem cell medium containing DMEM/F12 (Gibco), B27 (1, Gibco), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF, 20 ng/ml;Sigma, USA),basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF,20 ng/ml; Upstate, USA), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, 10 ng/ml; Chemicon, USA), insulin (4 U/l; Sigma),with or without vincristine (5 ng/ml; Hualian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). This procedure was repeated every 24 h until several primary tumor spheres were visible under microscopy. At this point, all culture medium was discarded and the wells were filled with 1 ml fresh serum-free neural stem cell medium.</p>
