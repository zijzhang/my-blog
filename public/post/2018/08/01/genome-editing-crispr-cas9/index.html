<h1 id="genome-editing">Genome editing</h1>
<p>Genome editing (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an organism&rsquo;s DNA.These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome. Several approaches to genome editing have been developed. A recent one is known as CRISPR-Cas9, which is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community because it is faster, cheaper, more accurate, and more efficient than other existing genome editing methods.</p>
<h1 id="crispr-cas9">Crispr Cas9</h1>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing system in bacteria. The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the bacteria to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; the viruses (or closely related ones). If the viruses attack again, the bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses&rsquo; DNA. The bacteria then use Cas9 or a similar enzyme to cut the DNA apart, which disables the virus.</p>

They report the result of a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of PD-1-edited T cell by CRISPR in patients with advanced NSCLC. Primaray endpoints were safety and feasibility, and the secondary endpoints was efficacy.</p>

This paper from Car June Lab of UPEN. Two genes encoding the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) chains, TCRα (TRAC) and TCRβ (TRBC), were deleted in T cells to reduce TCR mispairing and to enhance the expression of a synthetic, cancer-specific TCR transgene (NY-ESO-1). Removal of a third gene encoding programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1), was performed to improve antitumor immunity</p>
