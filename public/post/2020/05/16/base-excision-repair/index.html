<p>Enzymes that remove bases from DNA</p>
<h1 id="long-patch-pathway">Long-patch pathway</h1>
<p>Glycosylase action is followed by the endonuclease APE1, which
cleaves the polynucleotide chain on the 5′ side. This, in turn,
attracts a replication complex that includes DNA polymerase δ/ε
and ancillary components. The replication complex performs a
short synthesis reaction extending for 2 to 10 nucleotides. The
displaced material is removed by the flap endonuclease (FEN1).
The enzyme ligase 1 seals the chain. This is called the long-patch
pathway</p>
<h1 id="short-patch-pathway">Short-patch pathway</h1>
<p>When the initial removal involves lyase action, the endonuclease
APE1 instead recruits DNA polymerase β to replace a single
nucleotide. The nick is then sealed by the ligase XRCC1/ligase 3.
This is called the short-patch pathway</p>
<h1 id="base-flipping">Base flipping</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A human enzyme, alkyladenine DNA glycosylase
(AAG), recognizes and removes a variety of alkylated substrates,
including 3-methyladenine(3mA), 7-methylguanine(7mG), and hypoxanthine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1-methyl-adenine is corrected by
an enzyme that uses an oxygenating mechanism. The methyl group is
oxidized to a CH OH group, and then the release of the HCHO
moiety (formaldehyde) restores the structure of adenine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most common reactions in which a base is directly
removed from DNA is catalyzed by uracil-DNA glycosylase. Uracil
typically only occurs in DNA because of spontaneous deamination
of cytosine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another enzyme that uses base flipping is the photolyase that
reverses the bonds between pyrimidine dimers</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="an-exception">An exception</h1>
<p>Rad4 flips out the two adenine bases that are complementary to the linked thymines in a pyrimidine dimer, rather than flipping out the damaged pyrimidine
dimer itself. the protein uses flipping as an indirect mechanism to detect
the loss of a normal base-paired DNA double helix.</p>
