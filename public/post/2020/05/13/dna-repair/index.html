<main>
<h1 id="concept">Concept</h1>
<p>The measured rate of mutation reflects a balance between the
number of damaging events occurring in DNA and the number that
have been corrected.</p>
<p>The response to damage includes activation and
recruitment of repair enzymes; modification of chromatin structure;
activation of cell cycle checkpoints; and, in the event of insufficient
repair in multicellular organisms, apoptosis</p>
<h1 id="three-type-damage">Three type damage</h1>
<ol>
<li>single-base changes : deamination of cytosine to uracil</li>
<li>structural distortions/bulky lesions,</li>
<li>strand breaks</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="direct-repair">Direct repair</h1>
<p>One good example is photoreactivation of pyrimidine dimers<br>
Photoreactivation is a nonmutagenic repair system</p>
<h1 id="excision-repair">Excision repair</h1>
<p>directly replaces damaged DNA and then resynthesizes a replacement stretch for the damaged strand</p>
<h1 id="mismatch-repair-mmr">Mismatch repair (MMR)</h1>
<p>This system also recognizes insertion/deletion loops 
in which sequences present in one strand that are absent in the
complementary strand are looped out.<br>
Mismatches and
insertion/deletion loops that arise during replication are corrected
by distinguishing between the “new” and “old” strands and
preferentially correcting the sequence of the newly synthesized strand</p>
<h1 id="recombination-repair">recombination-repair</h1>
<p>use homologous recombination to replace the double-stranded region that has been damaged.</p>
<h1 id="uvr-excision-repair-system-in-e-coli">uvr excision repair system in E coli</h1>
<ol>
<li>uvrA, uvrB, and uvrC encode the components of a repair
endonuclease</li>
<li>a UvrAB dimer recognizes pyrimidine dimers and other bulky lesions.</li>
<li>UvrA dissociates (this requires
adenosine triphosphate [ATP]), and UvrC joins UvrB. The UvrBC
complex makes an incision on each side</li>
<li>UvrD is a helicase that helps to unwind the DNA to allow
release of the single strand between the two cuts</li>
<li>The enzyme that
excises the damaged strand is DNA polymerase I. The enzyme
involved in the repair synthesis also is likely to be DNA polymerase
I</li>
<li>short-patch repair 12bp  99%</li>
<li>long-patch repair 1500bp 1%</li>
<li>The Uvr complex can also be directed to sites of damage by other
proteins. For exampe Mfd</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="eukaryotic-nucleotide-excision-repair-pathways">Eukaryotic Nucleotide Excision Repair Pathways</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bulky lesions, such as those created by UV
damage, crosslinking agents, and numerous chemical carcinogens,
are also recognized and repaired by a nucleotide excision repair
system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a recessive disease
resulting in hypersensitivity to sunlight, and UV light in particular.
The deficiency results in skin disorders and cancer predisposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global renome repair and transcription coupled repair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In global genome repair (GG-NER),
the XPC protein detects the damage and initiates the repair
pathway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XPC also detects distortions that are not repaired by GG-NER (such as small
unwound regions of DNA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some types of damage, such as UV-induced
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), are not well recognized by
XPC. In this case, the DNA damage-binding (DDB) complex assists
in recruiting XPC to this type of damage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7.In contrast, transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER), the damage is
recognized by RNA polymerase II itself, which stalls when it
encounters a bulky lesion</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>The strands of DNA are unwound
for about 20 bp around the damaged site. This action is performed
by the helicase activity of the transcription factor TFIIH,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the transcription factor TFIIH, itself a
large complex, which includes the products of two XP genes, XPB
and XPD. XPB and XPD are both helicases; the XPB helicase is
required for promoter melting during transcription, whereas the
XPD helicase performs the unwinding function in NER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next step, cleavages are made on either side of the lesion by
endonucleases encoded by the XPG and XPF genes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>XPG is
related to the endonuclease flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), which
cleaves DNA during the base excision repair pathway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the single-stranded stretch including the damaged bases
can then be replaced by new synthesis, and the final remaining nick
is ligated by a complex of ligase 3 and XRCC1</p>
</li>
