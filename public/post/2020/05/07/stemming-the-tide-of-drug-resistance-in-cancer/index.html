<p>This is the biggest problem that we face in cancer drug development,There are a whole slew of different mechanisms that contribute to resistance. We need to be creative and think about how to exploit this biology</p>

<ol>
<li>Do other cancer–drug combinations similarly result in adaptive mutagenesis?</li>
<li>Does this process always involve downregulation of DNA-damage repair and upregulation of error-prone polymerases?</li>
<li>What upstream actors — and potential drug targets — detect the therapeutic stress and drive adaptive mutation?</li>
<li>And how do de novo mutations and pre-existing drug-resistant subclones act cooperatively to sidestep drugs</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="apobec">APOBEC</h1>
<p>APOBEC proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that can swap a cytosine base for a uracil.<br>
These proteins are part of the innate immune system, disrupting viral DNA to protect against infection, but they can also be hijacked by cancers to speed up mutation rates.<br>
APOBEC mutational signatures have been identified in at least 16 different cancers, and are associated with poor patient outcomes and treatment resistance.<br>
While the effects of these APOBEC-driven mutations are still a hot topic of research</p>
