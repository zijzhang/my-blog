<li>The biological function of Z-DNA and Z-RNA, nucleic acid structures with a left-handed double helix, is poorly understood1,2,3.</li>
<li>Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1; also known as DAI or DLM-1) is a nucleic acid sensor that contains two Zα domains that bind Z-DNA4,5 and Z-RNA6,7,8.</li>
<li>ZBP1 mediates host defence against some viruses6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14 by sensing viral nucleic acids6,7,10.</li>
<li>RIPK1 deficiency, or mutation of its RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), triggers ZBP1-dependent necroptosis and inflammation in mice15,16.</li>
<li>However, the mechanisms that induce ZBP1 activation in the absence of viral infection remain unknown.<br />

</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Here we show that Zα-dependent sensing of endogenous ligands induces ZBP1-mediated perinatal lethality in mice expressing RIPK1 with mutated RHIM (Ripk1mR/mR), skin inflammation in mice with epidermis-specific RIPK1 deficiency (RIPK1E-KO) and colitis in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific FADD deficiency (FADDIEC-KO).<br />
</li>
<li>Consistently, functional Zα domains were required for ZBP1-induced necroptosis in fibroblasts that were treated with caspase inhibitors or express RIPK1 with mutated RHIM. Inhibition of nuclear export triggered the Zα-dependent activation of RIPK3 in the nucleus resulting in cell death, which suggests that ZBP1 may recognize nuclear Z-form nucleic acids.</li>
<li>We found that ZBP1 constitutively bound cellular double-stranded RNA in a Zα-dependent manner. Complementary reads derived from endogenous retroelements were detected in epidermal RNA, which suggests that double-stranded RNA derived from these retroelements may act as a Zα-domain ligand that triggers the activation of ZBP1.</li>
<li>Collectively, our results provide evidence that the sensing of endogenous Z-form nucleic acids by ZBP1 triggers RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and inflammation, which could underlie the development of chronic inflammatory conditions—particularly in individuals with mutations in RIPK1 and CASP817,18,19,20</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Researchers describe their discovery of a new mechanism that could
contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The scientists &gt; found that ZBP1, a protein best known for defending against incoming
viruses, is activated by sensing an unusual form of cellular genetic
material (Z-nucleic acids), leading to cell death and inflammation.</p>
