<p><strong>Approach Template: R01</strong></p>
<p>&lt;1-2 sentences&gt;“Specific Aim 1: To &hellip;” List your first Specific Aim. This is a major heading so Boldit. Copy exactly from the Specific Aims page.</p>
<p>&lt;1-2 paragraphs&gt; Begin by reiterating the premise behind this specific aim (Rationale). Brieflyremind your reviewers what you are studying, reiterate your hypothesis, thesignificance, and what you hope to achieve.</p>
<p>&lt;1-2 paragraphs&gt; Briefly describe any background necessary to understand the context of theSpecific Aim. Explain what was previously known and what the deficit inknowledge is.</p>
<p>&lt;1 page&gt;Present your published data to support your hypothesis and/or the feasibility ofthe studies. If there are any key figures necessary to understand the work or toestablish feasibility, reproduce them here. Provide everything the reviewers willneed to understand and appraise your application. Make sure Reviewers candistinguish your data from others.</p>
<p>&lt;1-2 pages&gt;Present any additional unpublished preliminary data to support the feasibility ofyour Specific Aim and to show you can interpret results. Don’t waste space BUTmake sure figures are neat and big enough to be read easily. Additionalpreliminary data can be placed wherever needed to support aims or specificexperiments.</p>
<p>&lt;4-5 sentences&gt;Provide an overview of the sets of experiments to be performed explaining whatyou are testing and what methodologies will be employed. IT IS CRITICAL THATTHESE EXPERIMENTS CAN TEST YOUR HYPOTHESIS OR HYPOTHESES.</p>
<p>&lt;1/2– 1 Page&gt;Explain the methodological approach. Provide references to methods orreference preliminary data (e.g. Fig. X) to establish feasibility of non-standard orcomplex techniques.</p>
<p>&lt;1/2 – 1 Page&gt;If relevant provide details on animal models (sex, age, drug regimes, and doses,mouse strains, KO or transgenic mice and what their appropriate WT controlsare and what makes them ideal for your studies).If relevant provide details of human populations including, demographic data,sex selection, age selection, disease state, normal or other controls. ProvideInclusion and exclusion criteria.Use flow or other diagrams to clarify complex experimental designs and todelineate experimental arms.</p>
<p>&lt;1-2 paragraphs&gt; Interpret your data: Expected outcomes. Explain what your expected outcomeis for each experiment listed and how you will recognize that outcome based onthe methods used. Explain what this outcome will mean in terms of your hypothesis and the significance of this outcome to the big picture (moving thefield forwards and for human health).</p>
<p>&lt;1 paragraph&gt;Interpret your data: Alternative Outcomes. Experiments don’t always providethe expected data. Show that you have thought through the possible outcomesand explain what will be concluded if the outcome is different than expected.Focus on the positive. Will you learn something important even if the data is notas anticipated? Will you be able to devise a different hypothesis? How mightyou test it?</p>
<p>&lt;1 paragraph&gt;Caveats and alternative approaches: Are there any constraints, limitations ofmodels, patient populations, or in the methodology that could preclude adefinitive answer or lead to a failed experiment? Try to think of a solution andpose an alternative strategy for major caveats. Don’t list more than one or twomajor caveats, or a reviewer may doubt the feasibility of the approach. In anideal world preliminary data will have already established feasibility and willmitigate the potential for unanticipated outcomes and technical failures.</p>
<p>&lt;1 paragraph&gt;Provide Power Analysis for animal group size and/or human subjects. Justifythe feasibility of achieving these numbers in the proposed time frame(especially for human subject recruitment).</p>
<p>&lt;5-10 lines&gt;Provide a clear description of the Statistical Analysis to be employed.Remember to consider both parametric and non-parametric tests and to explainhow you will assess which is appropriate to use. Explain how you will performsimple comparisons, group comparisons, paired or unpaired data, etc. based onthe studies you are proposing. State clearly what you will consider significant(e.g. P &lt; or = 0.05).If you plan on using a statistical service or have a dedicated statistician workingon the project provide less detail on the statistics BUT provide and refer to aletter of support/collaboration documenting their role.</p>
<p>&lt;3-4 sentences &gt;Outline and justify your Time Line for the studies in the Specific Aim (Years X toY). If necessary explain any expected delays (mouse breeding or aging, patientrecruitment etc) and when you expect to complete the aims. This can beoptionally placed at the end of the Specific Aims to cover all Aims. Use adiagram if necessary.</p>
<p>&lt; As Above&gt;Repeat the steps above for additional Specific Aims.Do not unnecessarily duplicate information (e.g. preliminary figures, animalmodels, methods etc.) from Previous Aims, simply refer the Reader back, but bespecific as to where the information is located. Using numbered sections can behelpful if there is a lot of back referencing. For a new investigator 2 strongSpecific Aims is usually sufficien</p>
