      <description>My experience When doing the PhD thesis project, I want to detect the ROS-related genes expression by q-PCR. Nine sets of primers were used but only one of them had a positive result. The left eight genes were negtive in the cell line most colleagues used. It seemed impossible but it happened.
In the beginning, I suspected the primers were not right or in bad quality. Another eight new sets of primers were ordered but I still got negtive result.</description>

      <description>background Lots of slides were stained by immunohistochemisty, but i can not get good pictures. Today I recognized my misusage of microscope with my supervisor&#39;s help.
How should I take picutres withe microscope to get clear result? For the immunohistochemisty staining with DAB and couterstaining with hematoxilin.
At the beginning, I tried the bright field with Ph1 and it was wrong. The picutures were very urgly and seemed not like the real condition.</description>

      <description>Background I reviewed several manuscripts titled liket &amp;ldquo;XX promotes oxidative stress and induces apoptosis in YY cells&amp;rdquo;.
Here, &amp;ldquo;XX&amp;rdquo; can be any chemical from nature product or synthezed in the lab. &amp;ldquo;YY&amp;rdquo; can be caner cells, nenron cells and various cells. They may be cell lines or primary cells. By combination, hundreds of paper can be produced. How do you evaluate them in the perspective of basic reserch or drug development?</description>

      <description>The nature of cancer is abnormal proliferation of cells made of our organ, tissue and body.What drives physiology cells into crazy demons? Are genetic facrors or enviroment risks canse the transition of cells from health to disease?
