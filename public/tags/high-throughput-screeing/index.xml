      <description>1. Continuous vs Intermittent dosing  The title is &amp;ldquo;SWOG S1320: Improved progression-free survival with continuous compared to intermittent dosing with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF mutated melanoma&amp;rdquo;.
  There are several tantalizing preclinical examples to support intermittent or pulsatile therapy but little clinical evidence
  pusatile therapy: another form of intermittent therapy
 2. Combination of IO plus targeted therapy  Clearly works in certain contexts (e.</description>

      <description>TitleHigh-throughput identification of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities in mixtures of barcoded tumor cell lines
CitaionYu C, Mannan AM, Yvone GM, et al. High-throughput identification of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities in &amp;gt;mixtures of barcoded tumor cell lines. Nat Biotechnol. 2016;34(4):419–423. doi:10.1038/nbt.3460
AbstractHundreds of genetically characterized cell lines are available for the discovery of genotype-specific cancer &amp;gt;vulnerabilities. However, screening large numbers of compounds against large numbers of cell lines is currently &amp;gt;impractical, and such experiments are often difficult to control1-4.</description>
