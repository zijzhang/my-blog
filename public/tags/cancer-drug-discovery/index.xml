      <description>Consequences of mitotic slippage for antimicrotubule drug therapy
Antimitotic agents Microtubule poisons are divided into taxanes and vinca alkaloids depending on how they affect microtubule dynamics. Taxanes are microtubule-stabilising drugs that inhibit the dynamic instability of spindles; examples include commonly-used drugs such as paclitaxel and docetaxel. Vinca alkaloids depolymerise microtubules thereby preventing their attachment to kinetochores; drugs such as vinblastine, vincristine and vinolrelbine fall into this categor

      <description>Abstract The emergence of drug resistance limits the efficacy of targeted therapies in human tumors. The prevalent view is that resistance is a fait accompli: when treatment is initiated, cancers already contain drug-resistant mutant cells. Bacteria exposed to antibiotics transiently increase their mutation rates (adaptive mutability), thus improving the likelihood of survival. We investigated whether human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells likewise exploit adaptive mutability to evade therapeutic pressure. We found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/BRAF inhibition down-regulates mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination DNA-repair genes and concomitantly up-regulates error-prone polymerases in drug-tolerant (persister) cells.</description>

Paul Workman, President of The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)  This is the biggest problem that we face in cancer drug development,There are a whole slew of different mechanisms that contribute to resistance. We need to be creative and think about how to exploit this biology

      <description>TitleHigh-throughput identification of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities in mixtures of barcoded tumor cell lines
CitaionYu C, Mannan AM, Yvone GM, et al. High-throughput identification of genotype-specific cancer vulnerabilities in &amp;gt;mixtures of barcoded tumor cell lines. Nat Biotechnol. 2016;34(4):419–423. doi:10.1038/nbt.3460
AbstractHundreds of genetically characterized cell lines are available for the discovery of genotype-specific cancer &amp;gt;vulnerabilities. However, screening large numbers of compounds against large numbers of cell lines is currently &amp;gt;impractical, and such experiments are often difficult to control1-4.</description>
