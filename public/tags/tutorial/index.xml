      <description>Consensus clusteringConsensus Clustering is a method that provides quantitative evidence for determining the number and membership of possible clusters within a dataset, such as microarray gene expression.This method has gained popularity in cancer genomics, where new molecular subclasses of disease have been discovered.
The Consensus Clustering methodit involves subsampling from a set of items,such as microarrays, and determines clusterings of specified cluster counts (k).Then, pairwise consensus values, the proportion that two items occupied thesame cluster out of the number of times they occurred in the same subsample,are calculated and stored in a symmetrical consensus matrix for each k</description>

      <description>background Lots of slides were stained by immunohistochemisty, but i can not get good pictures. Today I recognized my misusage of microscope with my supervisor&amp;rsquo;s help.
How should I take picutres withe microscope to get clear result? For the immunohistochemisty staining with DAB and couterstaining with hematoxilin.
At the beginning, I tried the bright field with Ph1 and it was wrong. The picutures were very urgly and seemed not like the real condition.</description>
