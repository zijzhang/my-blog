      <description>background Lots of slides were stained by immunohistochemisty, but i can not get good pictures. Today I recognized my misusage of microscope with my supervisor&amp;rsquo;s help.
How should I take picutres withe microscope to get clear result? For the immunohistochemisty staining with DAB and couterstaining with hematoxilin.
At the beginning, I tried the bright field with Ph1 and it was wrong. The picutures were very urgly and seemed not like the real condition.</description>
